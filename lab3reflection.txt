MVC critique:

One large flaw is in the view section, where there is a function moveit. There should be no logic
in view, and instead it should observe the model.

The controller should not issue draw calls.
Use event handler so that the controller does not need to know about the view/model.

CarView should not be named GUIView or something like that

Carcontroller: Arraylist<Vehicle> cars should probably be part of model, not controller


General code:
Use lists for all the goddamn buttons
Events!!!
Carview is more like the controller, with all its buttons
Should draw be more as a service: draw(type: string, pos: Vector2D)



Using events: principle of least knowledge
Drawpanel observing: MVC. decouple
